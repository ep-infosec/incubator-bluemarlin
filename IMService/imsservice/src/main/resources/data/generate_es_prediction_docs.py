"""
This script generates sample predicted inventory documents and pushes to elasticsearch.
Each document is called uc-doc.
The script generates <num_of_generated_docs> number of uc-docs.

Each uc-doc has 2 parts:

The first part is related to traffic criteria which includes the following fields:
"a" : age category [1, 2, 3, 4]
"g" : gender [g_m, g_f, g_x]
"m" : media or channel
"ipl" : IP location
"r" : residence
"t" : network type
"pm": price model [CPD, CPC, CPT, CPM]

The second part contains predicted inventory amount.
  "predictions" : {
              "2018-01-02" : [
                {
                  "h2" : 800,
                  "h3" : 0,
                  "h0" : 0,
                  "h1" : 3700,
                  "total" : 4500
                },
                .
                .
                .
 The inventory data is hourly based hence each day has 24 sub-documents.
 Every inventory sub-document (h-doc) has the following fields:
 
 "h0" : amount of inventory with no price tag
 "h1" : amount of inventory with price tag of category 1
 "h2" : amount of inventory with price tag of category 2
 "h3" : amount of inventory with price tag of category 3
 "total" : amount of total inventory for that hour
