"""
This script generates sample tbr documents and pushes to elasticsearch.
Each document is called tbr-doc.

A tbr-doc contains traffic-behavior values. These values are used to calculate tbr-ratio which 
explains how traffic is sliced by multi-value traffic features. 

A multi-value traffic feature is a feature that can be mapped to many possible values. This feature is not directly
presented in traffic but is derived from other single-value features. 
   
The script generates <num_of_generated_docs> number of tbr-docs.

Each tbr-doc has 2 parts:

The first part is mainly related to multi-value traffic features which includes the following fields:
(single-values might be used in tbrdoc to increase the accuracy of tbr system as they link tbr documents with ucdocs.)

"a" : age category [1, 2, 3, 4] (single-value)
"g" : gender [g_m, g_f, g_x] (single-value)
"dm" : device model
"ai" : app interest
"au" : app usage
"dpc" : device price category
"pda": audience 

The second part contains tbr values for each day.
 "days" : {
              "2018-01-02" : 635,
              "2018-01-03" : 351,
              "2018-01-01" : 482,
              "2018-01-06" : 470,
              "2018-01-07" : 492,
              "2018-01-04" : 163,
              "2018-01-05" : 371
            },
        
IMS Service contains the logic to calculate tbr ration based on tbr values and traffic criteria.
